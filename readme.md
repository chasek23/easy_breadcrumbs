# Readme for easy_breadcrumbs

##### Last Updated 10-28-2019

## Purpose

This package was created for an easy way to produce breadcrumb data in a python object. Originally
intended for django, but should be package agnostic

## Installation

- `pip install easy_breadcrumbs`

## Use

Temporarily annoying import. To import use `from easy_breadcrumbs.base import Breadcrumbs`. Will be updated when there is time

## Status

- Still in development! Do not use, need to organize backward depencies. I.E. need to handle direct links! Needs to take inheriting view to generate crumbs backwards
